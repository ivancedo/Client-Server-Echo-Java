# Client-Server-Echo-Java
This project implements an Echo server and client that communicate using sockets. The server listens on port 2000 and handles multiple client connections concurrently. Clients can send messages to the server, and the server echoes the same message back. If the message sent is "exit", the server closes the connection with that client.
